 * stale. A shortcut that only needs "is this key held right now" — like the
 * hold-to-release-mouse binding, which defaults to Left Alt — should therefore
 * poll GLFW directly instead of going through Minecraft's key-mapping state
 * machine, which otherwise makes it fight with other mods' Alt combos. The
 * {@code KeyMapping} stays the source of truth for <em>which</em> key is bound,
 * so players can keep rebinding it from the controls screen.</p>
