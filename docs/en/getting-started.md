# Getting Started

From zero to your first actually usable in-game UI.

One thing up front: this mod's pages are plain HTML/CSS/JS, and it ships with a built-in instruction manual for AI plus debugging support — **if you were already planning to have AI write your pages, install the mod in Section 1 and then jump straight to Section 8**; you don't need to read the parts in between. Sections 2–7 are for people who want to understand it themselves: confirm the mod works, write an HTML page, make it look good, open it in game, and drive it from code.

## 1. Installation

- CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kltytonui
- Modrinth: https://github.com/kltyton/KltytonUI

Official Maven:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://maven.sighs.cc/repository/maven-public/"
    }
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.kltyton.kltytonui:KltytonUI-forge-1.20.1:1.2.5.4'
}
```

This coordinate is for Forge 1.20.1. The repository also contains Fabric 1.20.1, Fabric 1.21.1, NeoForge 1.21.1, Fabric 26.1, and NeoForge 26.1 targets; choose the artifact for your loader and Minecraft version. The current source version is in the root `gradle.properties`.

## 2. Confirm It's Working

First, open Minecraft's Controls settings and bind KltytonUI's **Open Resource Manager**, **Toggle DevTools**, and **Reload Resources** actions. All three are unbound by default; Left Alt is bound by default to release the mouse while held.

Then press the key you assigned to **Open Resource Manager**.

This resource manager is itself an KltytonUI page — if it renders and responds to clicks, the mod is up and running. While you're there, note three features you'll use over and over:

- **Double-click an HTML file**: interactive preview, identical to opening it for real;
- **Right-click empty space → NEW FILE**: create a new page; the template comes with the usual settings preconfigured;
- **Right-click a selected file → REFERENCE**: generates the "how to open this page" code, ready to copy.

Whenever this guide refers to the resource manager, DevTools, or reloading resources, it means these configurable actions; it does not assume F10, F12, or END.

## 3. Your First Page

Two ways to create one: use NEW FILE with a template in the resource manager; or manually create `hello.html` under `<game directory>/kltytonui/screens/` (in a dev environment that's `run/kltytonui/`), then trigger **Reload Resources** so the mod picks it up.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="kui-viewport" content="mode=browser">
    <meta name="kui-mouse-events" content="intercept">
    <style>
        body { margin: 0; color: #eee; background: #20242b; font-size: 16px; }
        .panel { width: 360px; margin: 60px auto; padding: 16px; background: #303640; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <main class="panel">
        <h2>Hello, KltytonUI</h2>
        <p id="status">Waiting for click</p>
        <button id="btn" type="button">Click me</button>
    </main>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function () {
            document.getElementById("status").textContent = "Clicked";
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

It's just an ordinary web page. Only three things need explaining:

**The two metas are page configuration**: `kui-viewport` gives the page a browser-style logical viewport; `kui-mouse-events=intercept` makes the page intercept the mouse — without this line, clicks may not reach the page. Full explanation in the [meta section of KltytonScreen](guide/kltytonui-screen#page-meta-configuration); for now it's enough to know each one controls one thing.

**There are no browser default styles**: `h2`, `p`, and `button` come with no appearance at all — font size, color, and spacing are all yours to write. For which CSS works and which gets ignored, see [HTML/CSS Coverage](guide/html-css-coverage).

**Script support depends on the target**: Forge 1.20.1, NeoForge 1.21.1, and NeoForge 26.1 support page scripts; Fabric targets currently do not execute page scripts. KubeJS mod bindings are available only on Forge 1.20.1 and NeoForge 1.21.1. See [Web API](guide/web-api) and [Mod API](guide/kltytonui-api) for the capabilities and target differences.

**Paths**: the mod locates files by **logical path**, not disk location. If the file is at `<game directory>/kltytonui/screens/hello.html`, you write `screens/hello.html` in code — no `assets/...` prefix, no drive letters. Referencing CSS and images from inside a page works the same way. See [Resource Management](guide/resource-manager) for the rules.

When you're done writing, trigger **Reload Resources** (or refresh in the resource manager), then double-click `screens/hello.html` to preview. On targets with page-script support, clicking the button changes the text to "Clicked".

## 4. Make It Look Good with the Ore Theme

The page you just wrote runs, but its styling is bare. Don't write CSS from scratch — the built-in Ore theme is a ready-made MC style: pixel borders, dark stone surfaces, green/purple/gold accents, with buttons, cards, forms, tables, badges, and inventory slots all preconfigured. One line to include it:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/kltytonui/theme/ore/ore.css">
<body class="ore-theme">
```

Then apply class names: `<button class="button button-primary">`, `<div class="card">`, `<table class="table">`. The showcase page `kltytonui/theme/ore/example.html` (double-click it in the resource manager to open) demonstrates every component — just copy from it.

To change colors and spacing, override the `--ore-*` variables directly (see Section 9 for how). Component list: [ore-theme.md](guide/ore-theme).

## 5. Actually Opening the Page

Previewing is just for looks. To make the page pop up on its own on a key press, on world join, or on block right-click: right-click the page file in the resource manager → **REFERENCE**, and the open code is generated straight into your clipboard — paste it into your logic-side code to trigger it.

The same HTML has four kinds of hosts; REFERENCE lists all the ways to open it. Choose by scenario:

| Host | Scenario | Docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Screen | Full-screen UI: settings pages, menus | [kltytonui-screen.md](guide/kltytonui-screen) |
| Overlay | Floating layer: HUD, persistent status, notifications | [overlay-document.md](guide/overlay-document) |
| Container Screen | Inventories, machines — operating on real items | [container.md](guide/container) |
| WorldWindow | Display screens in the world, labels above entity heads | [world-window.md](guide/world-window) |

The HTML is written the same way for all four hosts; the only differences are where the page appears and who supplies the data. Multiple pages can be alive at once: a full-screen UI open, overlays on the HUD still running, and windows floating in the world — none of them interfere with each other.

## 6. Driving the Page from Outside

The page's internal `<script>` manipulating the DOM was covered above. External code first gets hold of the page, then uses the same Java API; the KubeJS example is for Forge 1.20.1 and NeoForge 1.21.1 only:

```javascript
// KubeJS client script
var docs = KltytonUI.getDocument("screens/hello.html");   // note: returns a list
if (docs.length > 0) {
    var status = docs[0].getElementById("status");
    status.textContent = "HP: 20";
    status.setAttribute("class", "warning");
}
```

```java
// Java
List<Document> docs = KltytonUI.getDocument("screens/hello.html");   // also a list
if (!docs.isEmpty()) {
    Element status = docs.get(0).getElementById("status");
    status.setTextContent("HP: 20");
    status.setAttribute("class", "warning");
}
```

`getDocument(path)` returns a list because **the same path can have multiple instances open** — to manage a specific one precisely, keep the object returned by `createDocument` when you create it, or use `getDocumentByUUID`. DOM operations are identical on both sides: `getElementById` / `querySelector` to find elements, `textContent` (`setTextContent` in Java) to change text, `setAttribute` to change attributes, `addEventListener` to bind events.

Two pitfalls:

- **The page must exist first**. If it has never been opened, `getDocument` returns an empty list — call `createDocument` first or wait for the page to load;
- **All old references go stale after a refresh**. Reloading rebuilds the entire page, so confirm the generation before touching the DOM in async callbacks — see ["Threads, Nulls, and Refresh" in the mod API](guide/kltytonui-api#threads-null-values-and-refresh).

Full API: [kltytonui-api.md](guide/kltytonui-api).

## 7. Day-to-Day Changes: Use DevTools

You can edit pages live in game with DevTools. It is basically the MC version of browser developer tools:

- **DOM tree**: expand level by level on the left; hovering highlights that element's margin/border/padding/content regions on the page; right-click to add child elements, hide, delete, or copy outerHTML and selector;
- **Pick mode**: after activating it the cursor becomes a crosshair; moving over the page highlights the hit element in real time, and one click locates it in the tree;
- **Three inspector panels**: Attributes edits attributes; Styles edits inline styles (individual declarations can be temporarily disabled, color values come with a color picker), and below that is the **list of matched CSS rules** — which rule wins, what overrides it, and which file it comes from, all at a glance; when styling looks wrong, look here first; Box Model shows the box model numbers;
- **Mistakes are undoable**: Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z; edit history is kept per document;
- **Happy with it? Hit save to write back to the source file**: if you only changed styles, only the modified CSS rules are written back (even across multiple CSS files); if you changed structure, check "save DOM tree" to serialize the entire current DOM back to HTML. Read-only files from resource packs are refused with an explanation — nothing gets written anywhere weird;
- **Console**: collects `console.log` output and errors from page scripts, filterable by level and searchable by keyword; the input box accepts restricted commands (`$("#save")` to query elements, `tree`, `count()`, and so on), not an arbitrary JS interpreter;
- **Meta editing**: directly edit the current page's charset, the three kui-* metas, and runtime zoom, without hand-editing the HTML head;
- **Settings**: toggle debug configs like `autoReload` right in the panel, no digging through toml files.

To re-run the current page, use the "reload document" button in the toolbar. **Reload Resources** rescans and refreshes all pages.

Either kind of reload rebuilds the page, and every old element reference in your scripts goes stale — put initialization logic in `DOMContentLoaded` so it rebinds on every rebuild. See the [lifecycle section of Web API](guide/web-api#lifecycle-and-refresh). For the full feature list see [devtools.md](guide/devtools).

## 8. Let AI Write It for You

The mod ships with a complete set of AI-assisted development support. Set it up once, and most of the work of writing pages can be handed to AI afterwards.

**Step 1: give the skill to the AI.** [docs/ai-skill.md](ai-skill) is a self-contained instruction manual written for AI — path rules, metas, the four hosts, containers, and the debugging workflow are all in there. Three options: paste it into the conversation, put it in a directory the AI can read, or give the GitHub link directly (`https://github.com/kltyton/KltytonUI/blob/main/docs/ai-skill.md`). Once given, you don't need to relay the rules yourself anymore.

**Step 2: turn on two switches** (`config/kltytonui-client.toml`):

```toml
[debug]
autoReload = true
aiAutoScreenshot = true
```

- `autoReload`: when the AI finishes editing a file and saves, it takes effect in game immediately — CSS changes only re-attach styles without even losing page state; HTML/JS changes only refresh the affected pages;
- `aiAutoScreenshot`: automatically takes a screenshot every second into `<game directory>/screenshots/kui/`, so the AI can read the image itself to confirm rendering results instead of you describing "what it looks like".

**Step 3: just ask normally.** The loop from then on: you say what to change → the AI edits files under `<game directory>/kltytonui/` → it takes effect automatically → the AI checks the screenshots and digs through `logs/latest.log` to self-verify. If conditions allow, the AI can also connect via MCP directly to the running page (tools are under `tools/` in the GitHub repo, not distributed with the mod — use them if you can get them) to query the DOM and click buttons for interaction verification; not being able to connect doesn't affect the main workflow.

## 9. Building UIs with AI + Ore Theme

Two Ore theme files are especially important for AI. Give it these two and it can write correctly styled pages without you teaching it:

- **`ore.css`**: the authoritative definition of all class names and `--ore-*` variables;
- **`example.html`**: usage examples for every component.

The logical paths of the two files are `/kltytonui/theme/ore/ore.css` and `kltytonui/theme/ore/example.html` respectively (double-clicking example in the resource manager shows all components live). Three options for getting the file contents:

- GitHub raw: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kltyton/KltytonUI/main/common/src/main/resources/assets/kltytonui/kltytonui/kltytonui/theme/ore/ore.css` (for example.html, swap in the file name from the same directory);
- The mod jar: a jar is essentially a zip; after extracting, look in `assets/kltytonui/kltytonui/kltytonui/theme/ore/`;
- If you have a local clone of the repo: `common/src/main/resources/assets/kltytonui/kltytonui/kltytonui/theme/ore/`.

What to tell the AI, roughly:

> Following the rules in ai-skill.md, write an KUI page: such-and-such settings screen. Use the Ore theme; refer to this ore.css for class names and variables, and this example.html for component structure.

One reminder: **to change colors, have the AI override variables — don't modify ore.css** — write overrides like `--ore-green: ...` in your own CSS file (included after ore.css). Editing the theme files inside the jar does nothing anyway, and shadowing them locally with same-named files will only confuse you.

## 10. How to Troubleshoot

In this order:

1. **DevTools**: for styling problems, look at the Inspector's "matched rules" list — which rule wins, what overrides it, and which file it comes from; for structure problems, use pick mode to click an element and locate it straight in the DOM tree; script errors and console output are all in the console tab. Feature details in Section 7 and [devtools.md](guide/devtools);
2. **Check the logs**: search `logs/latest.log` for the `[KUI HTML]`, `[KUI JS]`, `[KUI CSS]` prefixes — errors come with resource paths;
3. **Out-of-game debugging**: the mod can run a local debug service; `tools/` ships a Node client and an MCP bridge, so AI tools can connect directly to running pages to query the DOM and simulate clicks. How to enable and use it: see [tools.md](guide/tools).
