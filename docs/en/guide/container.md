# Container Usage Documentation

The KubeJS examples in this guide apply to Forge 1.20.1 and NeoForge 1.21.1; the Java API is available on the other targets. See the [overview](overview#loader-and-script-support) for the full matrix.

A container page has two layers, and both are required:

- The `<container>` and `<slot>` elements in the HTML handle page structure, slot positions, and styling;
- The server-side Menu and data sources handle real items, clicks, shift-clicks, permissions, and persistence.

Only when both sides match up can slots actually hold and transfer items. Writing a `<slot>` on the client alone will not conjure up a real slot.

## Opening Methods

| Entry point | What it opens | Real slots |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `new KltytonScreen(path)` (client) | A pure UI Screen | None |
| `KltytonUI.screen(path)` (client) | A UI-only container Screen | None — even if the HTML declares `bind="player"` |
| `KltytonUI.menu(player, path).bind(...)` (server) | KltytonContainerScreen | Yes |

The key point: **for a real container you must go through `menu(...).bind(...)` on the server**. `screen(path)` only requests opening a UI page that looks like a container.

## Minimal Example

`screens/inventory.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="kui-viewport" content="mode=browser">
    <style>
        body { margin: 0; padding: 12px; color: #e2e8f0; background: #1e293b; }
        container { display: grid; gap: 2px; width: max-content; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div>Machine Inventory</div>
    <container id="saved_data" bind="saved_data" primary="true" size="9"></container>

    <div>Player Inventory</div>
    <container id="player" bind="player" layout="preset:player"></container>
</body>
</html>
```

Opening from the server (KubeJS server scripts use the same pattern):

```java
public static void open(ServerPlayer player) {
    KltytonUI.menu(player, "screens/inventory.html")
            .bind(binding -> binding
                    .saveddata("machine_data", 9)
                    .player());
}
```

`bind(...)` immediately resolves the data sources and opens the menu. Note that the first argument of `saveddata("machine_data", 9)` is the SavedData data name, not the HTML container id.

**Container ids are fixed** — this is the easiest pitfall to hit:

| Binding method | Required HTML id |
| --- | --- |
| `player()` | `player` |
| `saveddata(...)` | `saved_data` |
| `blockEntity(pos)` | `block_entity` |
| `entity(entityId)` | `entity` |

If the HTML uses `id="machine"` while the server calls `blockEntity(pos)`, the two sides don't match and all slots degrade into display-only slots.

## Binding API

`KltytonUI.menu(player, path)` returns a PendingMenu; calling `bind(...)` actually opens it. If the callback declares no data source at all, a UI-only menu opens — in which case you might as well use `screen(path)` directly.

| Method | Capacity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `player()` | Fixed 36 | Player inventory + hotbar; local indexes 0-8 are the hotbar, 9-35 the inventory |
| `saveddata()` / `saveddata(name)` / `saveddata(name, cap)` | Default 9 | World-level persistent inventory; data name defaults to `kltytonui_data` |
| `blockEntity(pos)` / `blockEntity(pos, cap)` | capability capacity | The block entity's Forge ITEM_HANDLER |
| `entity(id)` / `entity(id, cap)` | capability capacity | The entity's ITEM_HANDLER |

Passing capacity 0 means using the data source's full capacity (SavedData has at least 1 slot).

You can chain multiple bindings of different types: `binding.blockEntity(pos).saveddata("cache", 9).player()`. The first non-player binding automatically becomes primary (which decides the shift-click direction), even if `player()` is written first.

### Item insertion filters

A non-player binding step supports `.slot("selector").filter(FilterUtil)`; the type returned by `player()` **does not expose** either `slot(...)` or `.filter(...)`. The argument is an existing CSS selector matched against direct child-owned `<slot>` elements of the most recently declared container: for example, `#fuel`, `slot.fuel`, or `slot[slot-index="0"]`. An id is not required. Selectors resolve after the client expands automatic, repeated, and implicit-index slots; the server installs rules only for validated local indices. A filter restricts only which items can be **inserted** into matched slots. It does not restrict extraction and does not replace underlying capability/container restrictions. Overlapping selectors narrow a slot with AND.

```html
<container id="block_entity" bind="block_entity" size="3">
    <slot id="input" slot-index="0"></slot>
    <slot id="fuel" slot-index="1"></slot>
    <slot id="output" slot-index="2"></slot>
</container>
```

```java
FilterUtil fuel = FilterUtil.anyOf(FilterUtil.item(Items.COAL), FilterUtil.tag("c:coals"));
KltytonUI.menu(player, "screens/furnace.html")
        .bind(binding -> binding.blockEntity(pos)
                .slot("#input").filter(FilterUtil.not(FilterUtil.item(Items.LAVA_BUCKET)))
                .slot("#fuel").filter(fuel)
                .player());
```

KubeJS uses the same factories and composition semantics:

```javascript
KltytonUI.menu(player, "screens/furnace.html")
    .bind(function (binding) {
        binding.blockEntity(pos)
            .slot("#input").filter(FilterUtil.not(FilterUtil.item(Items.LAVA_BUCKET)))
            .slot("#fuel").filter(FilterUtil.anyOf(FilterUtil.item(Items.COAL), FilterUtil.tag("c:coals")))
            .player();
    });
```

`FilterUtil` is usable from Java and KubeJS: `ANY` accepts all items; `NONE` rejects all items; `EMPTY` accepts only an empty ItemStack. Use `item(Item)`, `tag(String)` / `tag(TagKey<Item>)`, `custom(Predicate<ItemStack>)`, `allOf(...)`, `anyOf(...)`, and `not(...)`; existing filters can also be composed with `and(...)`, `or(...)`, and `negate()`. Not calling `.filter(...)` preserves the existing behavior. The filtered view belongs only to this KUI menu and never changes the machine capability, hoppers, or other menus globally. Missing, duplicate, invalid, or foreign slot ids are ignored server-side with a warning; automatically generated slots have no stable id and cannot be filtered.

This is an API migration: the old `binding.blockEntity(pos).filter(...)` is removed; use `binding.blockEntity(pos).slot("...").filter(...)` instead. Only one binding per type is allowed — for two machines you need the advanced declaration API: `KltytonScreenNetworkHandler.openScreen(player, path, declarations, argsById)`. Each `ContainerDeclaration` carries its own id, type, capacity, and primary flag; parameters are passed through argsById (block_entity requires `x/y/z`, entity requires `entity_id`, saved_data optionally takes `data_name`). The HTML container ids must match the declaration ids. This is meant for Java mod code; KubeJS scripts generally won't need it; this advanced entry point does not accept slot-filter rules.

Legacy entry points (`openScreen`, etc.) still exist, but new code should not use them. Things like `KltytonUI.bind()` and `primarySavedData()` from old examples are no longer current API.

## The container Element

| Attribute | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | ID for the DOM and menu layout; always write it explicitly and keep it consistent with the server-side declaration |
| `bind` | `player` / `saved_data` / `block_entity` / `entity`; expresses the type and participates in automatic slot generation |
| `size` | Desired number of generated slots |
| `primary` | Shift-click primary container (only effective on the low-level declaration path, see below) |
| `layout` | Only controls DOM layout; does not create a data source |

Containers have no title mechanism; the `title` attribute does not draw a title. Use a plain div for titles.

IDs may only contain lowercase letters, digits, and `_ . / -`. When the ID is missing or invalid, ids like `c0`, `c1` are generated in order. A container nested inside another container does not count as an independent server-side declaration.

**Automatic slots**: when a container has a non-empty `bind` (or `primary="true"`), contains no handwritten plain slots, and `size` is a positive integer (or `bind="player"`), the expander automatically generates slots with proper indexes. So an empty container with `bind="player"` directly gets 36 slots. As soon as you handwrite one slot, nothing is auto-filled — write them all or none.

## Data Sources

**Player inventory**: binds the real inventory, not a copy.

**SavedData**: a world-level persistent inventory stored in the overworld data storage; distinguished by container id under the same dataName. Changing capacity rebuilds the inventory — expanding preserves items, **shrinking physically truncates them**. It is world data, not a personal inventory; to isolate per player, embed the UUID into the data name yourself.

**Block entity**: takes the ITEM_HANDLER from `Direction.UP` first, then the directionless one. On open it checks that the chunk is loaded, the block entity exists, a capability is present, and the requested capacity is within bounds. If the block entity is removed or the player moves more than about 8 blocks from the block center while the menu is open, the menu closes.

**Entity**: resolves the capability by server-side entity ID, with the same liveness and roughly 8-block distance checks. Entity resolution always happens on the server; never use client coordinates or HTML attributes for permission checks.

## Slot Mapping

The `slot-index` in the HTML is a **local index within the container**. Its relation to the server-side global menu index is:

```text
global index = container's baseIndex + slot's local slot-index
```

`slot-index` takes priority over the legacy `index` attribute. When neither is written, the expander fills in the smallest unoccupied index and logs a warning — for real slots, write `slot-index` explicitly, or simply use an empty container with automatic generation.

Binding rules (SlotDataBinder scans every slot):

1. In a UI-only menu all slots are display-only;
2. In a real menu, a slot inside a container whose local index is valid and whose container id matches a server-side declaration binds a real slot;
3. Slots outside containers, slots that can't be mapped, and recipe-generated ones are all display-only.

Don't let two slots in the same container use the same `slot-index`; the later-scanned one overwrites the earlier one.

After binding, the framework syncs each HTML slot's coordinates, size, and disabled state to the Minecraft menu slot, and rebinds after `refresh()`.

## The slot Element

**Real slots** display the ItemStack from a data source and support clicks, drags, and shift-clicks following MC menu rules. **Display slots** show items through a direct `<item>` or `<ingredient>` child, are not connected to any data source, and suit use cases like encyclopedias, recipe previews, and decoration. Display markup inside a real slot does not override its data-source item.

**Interaction control** (highest to lowest priority): recipe-generated slots are never interactive → CSS `--kui-slot-interactive` → HTML `interactive` → HTML `pointer` → real bindings are interactive by default. For display slots, explicitly writing `interactive="0" pointer="0"` is recommended to keep the semantics stable. `disabled="true"` likewise rejects menu operations.

**Render control**:

| Syntax | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `render="all" / "item" / "bg" / "none"` | Master switch |
| `render-bg` / `render-item` | Individual control |
| `--kui-slot-render-bg` / `--kui-slot-render-item` | CSS version, takes priority over HTML attributes |

**Size and appearance**: `size` (or `slot-size` / `--kui-slot-size`) controls the logical size and participates in hit-testing and item centering; `iconScale` (`--kui-slot-icon-scale`) scales the item; `zIndex` (`--kui-slot-z`) controls draw order.

Write display item expressions inside `<item>` or `<ingredient>`, not directly in `<slot>`; for the syntax, Ingredient JSON, item-tag candidates, and cycling options, see [Minecraft Item and Recipe Elements](mc-elements).

**The repeat pitfall**: `repeat="9"` only participates in capacity inference; it does **not** clone one DOM slot into nine. For bulk slots, use an empty container with `size` and automatic generation.

## Player Inventory Preset

```html
<container id="player" bind="player" layout="preset:player"></container>
```

Empty container + preset = 36 slots arranged in the vanilla style: indexes 9-35 form three inventory rows on top, 0-8 the hotbar at the bottom. Handwriting slots works too (they must be direct children of the container with correct slot-index), but there's no reason to make life hard for yourself.

## Recipe Previews

Recipe previews are generated by `<recipe>`; they are not real menu slots and cannot be interacted with. See [Minecraft Item and Recipe Elements](mc-elements#recipe-recipe-preview) for its type values, supported recipe categories, generated layouts, and error state.

## Lifecycle and Quick Move

Open flow: server resolves data sources and capacities → constructs the SlotLayout and menu → client creates the Document → the expander generates DOM slots → SlotDataBinder binds and syncs coordinates → afterwards clicks and drags all go through the MC menu.

After opening, changing `bind`, `size`, or `slot-index` on the client cannot alter the server-side binding. Slots are rebound after `refresh()`, so don't keep old slot objects. On close: the body receives unload, the Document is removed, and SavedData is marked dirty.

**Shift-click direction** is decided by primary: shift-clicking from the player inventory prioritizes the primary non-player container, and vice versa back to the player inventory. Primary is determined by the server-side binding order (or the advanced declaration's `ContainerDeclaration.primary`) — `primary="true"` in the HTML does **not** override the server-computed result under the recommended menu entry point.

## Viewport and Coordinates

Container pages use the same meta configuration as ordinary Screens (see the [KltytonScreen meta section](kltytonui-screen#page-meta-configuration)). Slot DOM coordinates are logical coordinates; the framework reads the viewport scale and syncs them to the menu — don't multiply by renderScale manually in scripts.

Also, `KltytonUI.getCurrentScreenDocument()` returning null for a container Screen is normal; it only recognizes KltytonScreen.

## Security

- Changing DOM attributes on the client cannot gain access to new data sources;
- Distance, capability, and stillValid checks all happen on the server;
- But distance checks only govern the menu lifecycle — **business permissions (whether this machine is yours) must be checked yourself before opening**.

## FAQ

**The page opened but all slots are empty**: did you use `screen(path)` instead of server-side `menu(...).bind(...)`? Do the container ids match the fixed IDs? Does the target have an ITEM_HANDLER?

**repeat didn't expand**: expected behavior; use an empty container + size.

**A slot is visible but not clickable**: is it inside a container? Is the id correct? Does slot-index exceed the capacity? Is it recipe-generated? Any `interactive="0"` / `pointer="0"` / `disabled` / an ancestor's `--kui-slot-interactive:0`?

**Block entity won't open**: is the chunk loaded? Does the block entity exist? Does it have a capability? Is the distance over 8 blocks? Did you request an oversized capacity?

**Inventory layout is messed up**: use `layout="preset:player"` with indexes 0-35; don't lay out a grid in natural order.

**Shift-click goes the wrong way**: primary is determined by server-side binding order; changing the HTML primary attribute has no effect.

**SavedData items disappeared**: did you change the capacity? Shrinking truncates.

## Performance Tips

- For the player inventory use an empty container + preset; don't handwrite 36 slots;
- Real containers should declare only the number of slots that need to be shown;
- Don't put high-frequency animations and cycling on every slot;
- Use CSS for bulk styling instead of per-slot script changes.
